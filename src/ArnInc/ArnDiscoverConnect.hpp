[About Arn Discover Remote](\ref gen_discoverRemote)

This connector class manages client connections. Both as a list of possible _direct host_
addresses and using a service name for reolving into a _discover host_. The two methods can
coexist and as standard the _discover host_ has lowest priority number, i.e. tried first.

An _id_ is assigned to every connector. The _id_ should be chosen to describe the client
target or its purpose. It's not a host address or necessarily a specific host, as there
can be many possible addresses assigned to the ArnDiscoverConnector.

The _id_ will appear as an _Arn folder_, e.g. when _id_ is "WeatherData-XYZ" the
_connector folder path_ will be "Sys/Discover/Connect/WeatherData-XYZ/".

<b>Example usage</b> \n \code
    // In class declare
    ArnDiscoverConnector*  _connector
    ArnClient  _arnClient;

    // In class code
    _arnClient.addMountPoint("//");
    _arnClient.setAutoConnect(true);

    _connector = new ArnDiscoverConnector( _arnClient, "MyConnectionId");
    _connector->setResolver( new ArnDiscoverResolver());
    _connector->setService("My Service");
    _connector->addToDirectHosts("localhost");
    _connector->start();
\endcode
