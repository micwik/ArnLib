/*!
[About Arn Data Object](\ref gen_arnobj)

This valve class can control data stream to/from any ArnItemB derived class.
The class itself is derived from ArnItemB, so it could also be controlled by another
ArnItemValve. But most importent, it has a subset of ArnItem's methods to make it shareable
in the ARN tree.

ArnItemValve can be used "standalone", i.e. not beeing opened to the ARN tree. In this case
it is used by its setValue method and locally emits its changed() signal.

When opened to the ARN tree it can be used by its setValue method and it can also be remote
controlled as any other ArnItem. If locally set, this will as usual be reflected in the
ARN tree.

It's possible to use one ArnItemValve for controling _InStream_ and another for controlling
_OutStream_. The valve for each stream direction can then be set independently. The default
is using one valve for both stream directions.

This class is not thread-safe, but the _Arn Data object_ is, so this valve can be remote
controlled by an ArnItem.

<b>Example usage</b> \n \code
    // In class code
    _commonSapi = new ChatSapi( this);
    _commonSapi->open("//Chat/Pipes/pipeCommon", ArnSapi::Mode::Provider);
    _commonSapi->batchConnectTo( this, "sapi");

    // Control message flow to and from service api _commonSapi
    ArnItemValve*  arnValve = new ArnItemValve( this);
    arnValve->setTarget( _commonSapi->pipe());
    arnValve->open("//Chat/Valves/pipeCommon");
    *arnValve = true;  // Set valve open for message flow
\endcode
