//! Class for connecting to an _Arn Server_.
/*!
[About Sharing Arn Data Objects](\ref gen_shareArnobj)
[About Sync Rules](\ref gen_syncRules)

Connection can be made to a specific Host by connectToArn(). It's also possible to define
an _Arn Connection List_. Each host address is added to the list with a priority. The
priority is used to control the order at which the host addresses will be tried for
connection. Lowest priority number is tried first. Connection trials are started with
connectToArnlList(). The priority can also be used for selction in clearArnList() and
arnList().

<b>Example usage</b> \n \code
    // In class declare
    ArnClient  _arnClient;

    // In class code
    _arnClient.connectToArn("localhost");
    _arnClient.addMountPoint("//");
    _arnClient.setAutoConnect( true);
